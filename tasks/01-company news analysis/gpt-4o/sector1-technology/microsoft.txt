**Investment Insight:**
Based on the retrieved data, here is the relevant company news about Microsoft from 2024 to 2025:

- On March 4, 2025, it was reported that Microsoft's stock had reached its lowest level in over a year. The decline in Microsoft shares was associated with a broader selloff of technology stocks, particularly those impacted by the unwinding of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade. Despite this downturn, analysts from Evercore ISI suggested that Microsoft might not belong entirely to this group of struggling tech stocks, implying that the selloff might be overdone or an overreaction.

This is the only news related to Microsoft provided in the retrieved data, and the sentiment towards Microsoft's stock situation is labeled as neutral.
