**Investment Insight:**
To provide an analysis of Amazon's performance for the indicated period, I would need data for 2024 to 2025 covering the following aspects:

1. **Market Trends:** Information on overall stock market performance, e-commerce trends, and technology sector developments in which Amazon operates.
2. **Sector-Specific Developments:** Changes or trends in the e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital advertising sectors.
3. **Company-Specific News:** Financial performance reports, leadership changes, new product launches, business expansions, acquisitions, or legal matters related to Amazon.
4. **Macroeconomic Indicators:** Economic indicators such as GDP growth rates, employment data, consumer spending, interest rates, and inflation that might impact Amazon's business environment.

Once you provide this data, I can analyze these factors and offer a conclusion on Amazon's outlook for March 2025 as either "Bearish", "Somewhat-Bearish", "Neutral", "Somewhat-Bullish", or "Bullish".
